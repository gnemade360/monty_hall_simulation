# Monty Hall Simulation

Monty Hall Simulation is a Python program that simulates the famous probability puzzle known as the Monty Hall problem. The Monty Hall problem involves selecting one of three doors, behind one of which is a valuable prize, and behind the other two are goats. The program simulates the player's choice and the subsequent host's reveal, giving the player the option to stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door.
